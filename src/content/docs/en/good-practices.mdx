## Good Practices

Tips and recommendations to get the most out of Floogos.

## Clear names
Use descriptive names for your flows and nodes. Ex: `Send customer registration mail`.

## Reuse Logic
Group repeated nodes into template-like flows.

## Always test
Uses the **Test** button before activating a flow in production.

## Split into parts.
Prefer several small flows to one giant one.

## Control access
Don't share credentials and use appropriate roles.

## Cleanup
Remove obsolete or unused flows on a regular basis.
