# 🛠️ Create a Flow

Flows in Floogos are built step by step using modules (nodes) connected together.

## 📝 Instructions

1. Go to the **Flows** section.
2. Click on **New Flow**.
3. Give it a name and description
4. Add modules from the left panel
5. Connect them to each other by dragging the connectors.
6. Configure each module by clicking on it
7. Save and Activate

You can test the flow by clicking **Test** to see how it behaves with real data.

## 🔁 Best practices
- Start with simple nodes like Webhook or Start.
- Test decisions and validations with `Decision`.
- Always use `End` at the end of the flow
