## üìù Flow Description
1. An external request is received from an external system or web form via Webhook.
2. The data is validated (e.g., the email is not empty).
3. If validation passes, a personalized email is sent.
4. Optionally, a row with the data is saved to an Excel file or database.
5. The flow ends.
